        A cousin of the croissant is the Italian cornetto (in the Center and
        South) or brioche (in the North). These variants are often considered to
        be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends
        to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto
        or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the cornetto vuoto (Italian:
        "empty cornetto") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling,
        which include crema pasticciera (custard), apricot jam or chocolate
        cream. They often come covered with powdered sugar or other toppings.
        Cornetto with cappuccino at the bar is considered to be the one of the
        most common breakfasts in Italy.
